## 🔄 Flow Overview

The Practika platform is designed around three core user flows that create a seamless learning experience:

### **Core User Flows**
1. **Discovery & Learning**: Users discover content and learn through annotated videos
2. **Content Creation**: Users upload videos and create annotations for the community
3. **Playlist Management**: Users organize and execute personalized learning sequences

### **Design Principles**
- **User-Centered**: Every flow is designed with user needs and emotions in mind
- **Progressive Disclosure**: Information is revealed when needed, not all at once
- **Immediate Feedback**: Users get instant responses to their actions
- **Social Integration**: Community features enhance the learning experience
